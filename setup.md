# Programming environment

The GPU programming lesson can be taught using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
For this to work you we need a reasonably up-to-date browser.
The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all [supported](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility) (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

In case you do not have any GPU available on your laptop, a good alternative is to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
